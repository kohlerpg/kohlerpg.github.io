## Coopers Hawk
Was lucky enough to have my camera with me when I saw this Cooper Hawk hanging out. Shots where taken with my 135mm f/2 L lens.  The area was dark due to the number of evergreens in the area.  The first couple of shots were really dark. I hadn't packed my speedlite so I was stuck with using the onboard flash.  It actually did the trick and I was able to get some great shots.

After a couple of shots the hawk start to get aggresive, which leads me to believe that there was a nest in one of the trees.  A couple of passes were really close and I decided to go back to the car.  As I turned around to leave the hawk made one more pass and hit me.  My hat went flying off.  A first for me!
