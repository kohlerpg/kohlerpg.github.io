## Plex Project

For a while I have been considering building a media server.  One afternoon I decided it was time to repurpose my old Vaio laptop and build one.  After installing Linux Mint on the laptop I installed Plex.  There are quite a few guides and articles on the subject and the installation went pretty smooth.  There were one or two gotchas, but those could have been avoided if I had read the guides a little more thoroughly. The next couple of days I spent making changes to the configuration, customizing the install and testing.

I uploaded some media and began to use my new media server.  Streaming was about what I expected.  There was some buffering, but not bad.  The real issue came when there was another device streaming from the server.  The server became ususable. Not ideal, since the family will be using media server.  Now on to a bigger better server configuration.  So many choices.
