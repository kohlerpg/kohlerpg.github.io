## Final Plex Configuraion

After researching numerous hardware and software options I finally decided on the following. 

+ **Server:** Dell PowerEdge T110 II
+ **Storage:** 4 Western Digital 3.0 TB WD30EFRX drives
+ **Software:** FreeNAS 9.10.2

The decision on the Dell server was mostly based on finding a real good price on it.  The drives were also found on sale.  The choice for FreeNAS was based on reviews and the numerous how-to pages that I found.  

Storage is all dedicated to Plex.  Boot drive is a USB drive with FreeNAS installed on it.
