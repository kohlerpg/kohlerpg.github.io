## Plex Project

For some time I have wanted to build a media server.  After reading many of the articles written about such projects I thought it was time to try it out.  After reading all the advice and opinions on media server software I decided to go with Plex.  

I just happend to have an old Vaio laptop that would be a good test candidate.  After installing Linux Mint on the laptop I started the Plex install.  The install went well, a few gothas that were might fault for not reading the installation material well enough.  After installation I tested and made condiguration changes.  Most were recommendations from others that had attempted similar builds.  

I have media on the laptop and have been testing for about a week.  For the most part, the device has perfomred as expected.  There has been some buffering from time to time.  The real test was when I had two streams going at the same time.  It just couldn't handle the load.  Now onto a bigger better media server.
