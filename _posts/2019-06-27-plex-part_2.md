## Final Plex Configuration

After researching numerous hardware and software options I finally decided on the following. 

+ **Server:** Dell PowerEdge T110 II
+ **Storage:** 4 Western Digital 3.0 TB WD30EFRX drives
+ **Software:** FreeNAS 9.10.2

The decision on the Dell server was mostly based on finding a PowerEdge that was about to be replaced by a newer model. A deal to good to pass up. The drives were also found on sale.  The choice for FreeNAS was based on reviews I found online.  There were also many how-to guides on the Plex setup that I was to accomplish.  

Since the server was a dedicated Plex server all storage was dedicated to that.  I decided to use a USB drive as the boot device (even though some argued against it).
