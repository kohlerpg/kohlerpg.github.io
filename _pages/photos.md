##Photography

Although I don't get out as much as I like, I'm trying.  The good old days before my iPhone I would take my trusty Pentax K-1000 everywhere (then wait a week to see what I had shot).  One of the thing I love about photography is there is always more to learn.  From the equipment to the surroundings nothing is the same, always an adventure.
