<p>What have I been up to lately?  Here's a lists of things that I'm working on, what I'm listening to and what I'm watching.  Of course I'm continously working on this site.</p>
## Photography
-Working on transferring my photo portfolio to Adobe Portfolio.  After years of SmugMug I decided to make the switch and stop paying for both. 
-Moving Lightroom l ibrary to my Synology NAS.
## Music 
- Been on a Bryan Ferry kick lately. Recently purchased <i>Let's Stick together</i> and <i>In your mind</i>.  Both excellent, but have been listening to the latter the most. 
- Making progress in getting all of my CDs scanned into Discogs.  Slowly making headway, might be done soon??
- Working on modifications to my MusicBee instance.  Tweeking the Eleventy theme.

## Watching 
<p>Have been binge watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830617/">Grimm</a>. Currently up to Season 5.  </p>
