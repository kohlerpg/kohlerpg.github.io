### Music 
- Been on a Bryan Ferry kick lately. Recently purchased <i>Let's Stick together</i> and <i>In your mind</i>.  Both excellent, but have been listening to the latter the most. 
- Making progress in getting all of my CDs scanned into Discogs.  Slowly making headway, might be done soon??

### Watching 
<p>Have been binge watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830617/">Grimm</a>. Currently up to Season 5.  </p>
