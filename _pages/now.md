<p>So what have I been up to lately?  Here's a lists of things that I'm working on and things I am beginning to look into. Why? <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Here</a> you will find a good explanation of Now pages. </p>

### Music (2026)
- Been on a Bryan Ferry binge lately. Recently purchased <i>Let's Stick together</i> and <i>In your mind</i>.  Both excellent, but have been listening to the latter the most. 
- Making progress in getting all of my CDs scanned into Discogs.  Slowly making headway, might be done soon??
